ðŸ“± SMS Spam Detection - Project Introduction
In the digital age, SMS messaging continues to be a widely used method of communication. However, with its popularity comes the increasing problem of spam messagesâ€”unwanted texts that can be annoying, misleading, or even malicious. This project aims to tackle this issue using the power of Machine Learning.

Our SMS Spam Detection web application is built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. It incorporates a pre-trained machine learning model that can accurately classify incoming messages as spam or ham (not spam). The model uses text vectorization techniques to analyze and interpret message content before making predictions.

Key Features:
    A simple login system to authenticate users (mock-based for demonstration purposes).
    A dashboard where users can test the SMS classification functionality.
    Pre-trained ML model and vectorizer loaded dynamically during runtime.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in cybersecurity, particularly in filtering harmful or irrelevant content from user inboxes.
